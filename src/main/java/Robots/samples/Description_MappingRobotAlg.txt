MappingRobotAlg1:
Tracks the robots movements
Shows the cells robot traveled by 1

MappingRobotAlg2:
Tracks the robots movements
Shows the number of times the robot traveled to a cell
Robot checks the cellValue of north, east, south, west cells
Then travels to the cell with least number (precedence: NESW)
Proxomity sensor readings were not used in here
Supposed there are no obstacles

MappingRobotAlg3:
Update of MappingRobotAlg2
Proxomity sensor readings were used in here.
New alg used for the movements of robots

MappingRobotAlg4:
New alg. works fine

MappingRobotAlg5:


MappingRobotAlg6:
Proximity sensor range reduced. Corrected the alg. accordingly.

MappingRobotAlg7
PROXIMITY_BACK added

MappingRobotAlg8
after 30 steps reset free cells
